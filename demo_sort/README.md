What is this demo?

It demonstrates three things: algorithms, imports, and exception handling.

The user can only input integers. Anything else will be caught by the program and it will terminate. 

It utilizes Swing for the message and input boxes. 

Lastly, and most importantly, it utilizes bubble sort to arrange the three inputs from the user.

What else could be done to improve it?

I could allow the user to determine how many inputs they want. 

Another improvement would be ditching bubble sort if the user wants to input a large set of integers.

Instead of having the dialog box pop up each time for the input, a text box that allows the user to separate values by commas or spaces would be more "organic".
